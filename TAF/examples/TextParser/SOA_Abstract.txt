With the recent adoption of a service oriented architectural (SOA) approach to application development within defence there is a need to provide architectural guidance coupled with infrastructure mechanisms to assist developers through the implementation process.  Applications developed under a SOA approach are more akin to an assemblage rather than the more traditional development methodology of construct and execute. There is a growing collection of common services that are available for the tactical defence environment. However there exists the need to manage the availability of these services and their usage by applications through a common approach to infrastructure, configuration and deployment. This paper firstly describes how an application built with LASAGNE can be assembled from separate and distinct service components to form a composite application and then secondly how these components can be interconnected through a common patterned approach to infrastructure that incorporates the Component Configurator pattern. This common infrastructure, based on open standards, is necessary to manage the availability, configuration and deployment of hosted components. This change of emphasis to a patterned approach to application composition and assembly brings with it some unique challenges for both mission system architects and developers alike.
